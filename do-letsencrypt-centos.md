# How To Set Up a Remote Desktop with X2Go on Ubuntu 16.04

### Introduction

X2Go
x2go uses the nx library that was developed by NoMachine. All of the latency intensive parts of X forwarding was worked around by creating a nx proxy on each side of the network connection and sending compressed updates between the two proxies.

Basic features of X2Go
Graphical Remote Desktop that works well over both low bandwidth and high bandwidth connections
The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session, even from another client
Support for sound
Support for as many simultaneous users as the computer’s resources will support (NX3 free edition limited you to 2.)
Traffic is securely tunneled over SSH
File Sharing from client to server
Printer Sharing from client to server
Easily select from multiple desktop environments (e.g., MATE, GNOME, KDE)
Remote support possible via Desktop Sharing
The ability to access single applications by specifying the name of the desired executable in the client configuration or selecting one of the pre-defined common applications
